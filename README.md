The idea to player to player to select 2 to 6 players. Minimum of 1 human player. Up to 5 cpu players.

14 territory cards go in to center of the map. Each card has different capture requirements. A territory card will have combat lines on it.
Each combat line represents the required tropps to defeat the line. To capture a territory all combat lines must be defended.
Game continues until lass territory in centre is captured.

Each player gets a turn every round. The players turn is rolling their dice. These dice decide which resources are available.
Player select a territory to invade and allocates existing matching dice to a single combat line on a card.
Then rolls reminding dice. If none of the dice fit reminding combat lines on the remove one die and reroll.
